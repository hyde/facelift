# PINTEREST, WE HAVE A PROBLEM

Pinterest’s mission statement is to “connect everyone in the world through the
‘things’ they find interesting.” Its front-page reads, “Organize and share the
things you love.” Presumably, Pinterest is a place for users to collect the
pictures or videos they like and to connect with others who may have similar
tastes. Much like Tumblr, users can “repin” content from other members to
their own pinboards.

So, if you snap an awesome photograph, upload it to your blog, and someone
pins it, that person is either (1) claiming exclusive ownership of it; or (2)
giving Pinterest your consent to reproduce it (and you just thought you were
being flattered).

## IT GETS WORSE

When you add content to Pinterest, you grant the company (Cold Brew Labs) the
rights to do whatever they want with it, including selling it. Take a look:

> By making available any Member Content through the Site, Application or
> Services, you hereby grant to Cold Brew Labs a worldwide, irrevocable,
> perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right
> to sublicense, to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell,
> transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast,
> access, view, and otherwise exploit such Member Content only on, through or by
> means of the Site, Application or Services. Cold Brew Labs does not claim any
> ownership rights in any such Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be
> deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit any such
> Member Content.

In other words, you take on all of the legal fees, including Pinterest’s. Good deal.

## FAIR USE

Some invoke fair use as a defense against Pinterest’s terms of use. Fair use
is a doctrine that permits the limited use of copyrighted material without
ever acquiring the consent of the owners. The question is, does pinning an
image to Pinterest fall under the provisions of fair use?

The answer is unclear. According to Alyson Shontel, in Kelly v. Arriba Soft
Corporation, the US court ruled that a search engine may use thumbnails of
images without violating copyright laws. However, as Shontel points out,
thumbnails only fall under fair use when “the necessary portion of the work is
copied and nothing more.” Pinterest uses the entire image.

### SO WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?

Who cares if someone pins an image from your blog or website? It was out
there for everyone to see anyway. Anyone could print it, sell it, et cetera.


- Sure, but Pinterest makes the problem widespread.
- Users have no idea that they are tacitly giving Pinterest ownership over the content they pin.
- Furthermore, the company could turn around, exploit the content, and when the original photographer finds out and sues, guess who’s paying the bill? You.
- The problem, quite simply, is that Pinterest encourages users to do something potentially illegal without them ever knowing it, all the while absolving itself of any responsibility.

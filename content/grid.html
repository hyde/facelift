      <h2>Over 200,000 apps.</h2>
      <p>The App Store is home to over 200,000 apps and counting — all made just for iPad. And many of them are free. You buy apps from the App Store using the same Apple ID you use to buy music from iTunes. Find an app you like, tap to buy it, and it starts downloading instantly. iPad lets you know when updates are available, so your apps are always current.</p>

      <h2>Battery life spared.</h2>
      <p>The new iPad features a Retina display with four times the pixels of iPad 2 and quad-core graphics. How much of an effect does that have on battery life? Almost none. You still get up to 10 hours of power to read, watch, play, write, and create whatever you want, all you want.</p>

      <h2>Apps made just for iPad.</h2>
      <p>An app that’s made for iPad is genuinely made for iPad. That means it’s specifically designed to take advantage of the way iPad works. Need proof? Check out Apple’s beautiful iPhoto app on the new iPad. It’s just one of thousands of apps that let you do things with iPad you never thought possible. With iPhoto in the picture, the iLife family of apps for iPad.</p>

         <h3>Use the smart keyboard.</h3>
         <p>It suggests words, corrects spelling, and inserts punctuation. It recognizes email addresses from your contacts. And it supports over 50 languages.</p>

         <h3>Keep track of conversations.</h3>
         <p>Mail makes it easy by grouping messages in a thread. The original email and its many replies appear under the most recent message.</p>

         <h3>View attachments.</h3>
         <p>If an email contains images and photos, you’ll see them right in the message. And you can save them to your Camera Roll. Mail also lets you open PDF, iWork, or Microsoft Office files.</p>

         <h3>Add all your accounts.</h3>
         <p>Mail works with popular email providers including Google Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, and AOL — along with most industry-standard IMAP and POP systems.</p>

The grid system

Markdown

- optimal for mark5 editing
- no class names to remember


Real life

- responsive
- most common layouts fine tuned, 2+3+5+2 are left for user
- constraints are good, less design blocks
- graphic designers love this

Solid blocks

- based on: inline-block / box-sizing: border-box
- simple cells without margins (gutters)
- individual cells can have any padding
- IE7 CSS fallback

Images

- never grow outside the grid
- { max-width: 100%; }


Fixed sizing

- the hard fact: fixed sites look better than fluid
- precise design / predictable layout
- simpler: less bugs, less to test, less work


Use CSS3 columns for text
